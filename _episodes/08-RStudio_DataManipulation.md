## Importing tabular data into R

There are several ways to import data into R. For our purpose here, we
will focus on using the tools every R installation comes with (so called
"base" R) to import a tab-delimited file containing results from our
differential expression workflow. We will need to load the sheet using a
function called `read.table()`.

Now, let's read in the file `pregnant_lactate_sample.csv`, which
contains just 1000 random lines from the final `limma-voom` expression
table for that data set. Call this data `pregnant_lactate_sample`. The
first argument to pass to our `read.table()` function is the file path
for our data. The file path must be in quotes and now is a good time to
remember to use tab autocompletion. **If you use tab autocompletion you
avoid typos and errors in file paths.** Use it!


```r
# Note that that despite this being labeled as a ".csv" file, it is actually delimited by a tab, which you can specific with a "\t" separator. Never trust data at face value!
pregnant_lactate_sample <- read.csv("pregnant_lactate_sample.csv", sep="\t")
```

One of the first things you should notice is that in the Environment
window, you have the `pregnant_lactate_sample` object, listed as 1000
obs. (observations/rows) of 9 variables (columns). Double-clicking on
the name of the object will open a view of the data in a new tab.

A **data frame is the standard way in R to store tabular data**. A data
fame could also be thought of as a collection of vectors, all of which
have the same length. Using only a few functions, we can learn a lot
about out data frame including some summary statistics as well as well
as the "structure" of the data frame. Let's examine what each of these
functions can tell us:


```r
nrow(pregnant_lactate_sample)
```

```
## [1] 1000
```

```r
ncol(pregnant_lactate_sample)
```

```
## [1] 9
```

First, we can simply use the `nrow` and `ncol` functions to query how
many rows and columns a data frame has. This may not SEEM particularly
interesting, but it is extremely useful in functions that rely on doing
something like iterating over each row.


```r
summary(pregnant_lactate_sample)
```

```

```

Our data frame had 9 variables, so we get 9 fields that summarize the
data. The `LogFC`, `AveExpr`, and `P.value` variables (and several
others) are numerical data and so you get summary statistics on the min
and max values for these columns, as well as mean, median, and
interquartile ranges. Many of the other variables (e.g. `SYMBOL`) are
treated as character data. **Note**: Even though you shouldn't actually
do math or other manipulations on the `ENTREZID` variable, since R only
finds numbers in that column, it automatically assumes it is numeric and
tries to calculate summary stats.

Now, let's use the `str()` (structure) function to look a little more
closely at how data frames work:


```r
## get the structure of a data frame
str(pregnant_lactate_sample)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	1000 obs. of  9 variables:
##  $ ENTREZID : int  100503377 269003 66403 76223 108115 26931 20832 21846 66230 108058 ...
##  $ SYMBOL   : chr  NA "Sap130" "Asf1a" "Agbl3" ...
##  $ GENENAME : chr  NA "Sin3A associated protein" "anti-silencing function 1A histone chaperone" "ATP/GTP binding protein-like 3" ...
##  $ logFC    : num  0.999 0.102 0.241 -0.272 0.447 ...
##  $ AveExpr  : num  2.05 5.91 3.25 1.77 2.92 ...
##  $ t        : num  4.094 0.857 1.274 -1.015 2.413 ...
##  $ P.Value  : num  0.00115 0.40622 0.22391 0.3278 0.03051 ...
##  $ adj.P.Val: num  0.00617 0.52872 0.33765 0.44929 0.07379 ...
##  $ B        : num  -0.926 -7.008 -6.129 -6.078 -4.296 ...
```

Ok, thats a lot up unpack! Some things to notice.

-   the object type `data.frame` is displayed in the first row along
    with its dimensions, in this case 1000 observations (rows) and 9
    variables (columns).

-   Each variable (column) has a name (e.g. `ENTREZID`). This is
    followed by the object mode (e.g. chr, int, etc.). Notice that
    before each variable name there is a `$` - this will be important
    later.

**As a reminder, here is the interpretation of those variables:** \|
**Limma-voom output column** \| **Explanation** \| \| ENTREZID \| NCBI
Entrez ID for this differentially expressed gene \| \| SYMBOL \|
Abbreviated gene name \| \| GENENAME \| Full gene name \| \| logFC \|
log(2) fold change between the two experimental conditions
(basalpregnant vs. basallactate) \| \| AveExpr \| Average log(2)fold
change across all samples in comparison \| \| t \| moderated
t-statistic: t-statistic like those for a normal t-test, adjusted for
aspects of the experiment \| \| P.value \| P-value associated with the
above t-statistic \| \| adj.P.value \| p-value adjusted for multiple
testing \| \| B \| B-statistic is the log-odds that the gene is
differentially expressed. For reference, a B-statistic of 0 corresponds
to a 50-50 chance that the gene is differentially expressed. \|

## Working with Vectors in R:

We can think of each variable (column) of data in a `data.frame` as its
own independent `**vector**` storing a different piece of data for each
sample. Vectors are probably the most used commonly used object type in
R. A vector is a collection of values that are all of the same type
(numbers, characters, etc.). We can extract individual variables into
vectors using the `$` operator.


```r
# Use the $ sign operator
log_fc <- pregnant_lactate_sample$logFC

str(log_fc)
```

```
##  num [1:1000] 0.999 0.102 0.241 -0.272 0.447 ...
```

We can see that the vector log_fc now contains the LogFC data from our
data frame, stored as a numeric vector. Vectors always have a mode and a
length. You can check these with the mode() and length() functions
respectively.


```r
mode(log_fc)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
length(log_fc)
```

```
## [1] 1000
```

### Creating and subsetting vectors

Let's create a few more vectors to play around with:


```r
# Some interesting human SNPs
# while accuracy is important, typos in the data won't hurt you here

snp_genes <- c("OXTR", "ACTN3", "AR", "OPRM1")
snps <- c('rs53576', 'rs1815739', 'rs6152', 'rs1799971')
snp_chromosomes <- c('3', '11', 'X', '6')
snp_positions <- c(8762685, 66560624, 67545785, 154039662)
```

Once we have vectors, one thing we may want to do is specifically
retrieve one or more values from our vector. To do so, we use **bracket
notation**. We type the name of the vector followed by square brackets.
In those square brackets we place the index (e.g. a number) in that
bracket as follows:


```r
# get the 3rd value in the snp_genes vector
snp_genes[3]
```

```
## [1] "AR"
```

In R, every item your vector is indexed, starting from the first item
(1) through to the final number of items in your vector. You can also
retrieve a range of numbers:


```r
# get the 1st through 3rd value in the snp_genes vector

snp_genes[1:3]
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"  "ACTN3" "AR"
```

If you want to retrieve several (but not necessarily sequential) items
from a vector, you pass a **vector of indices**; a vector that has the
numbered positions you wish to retrieve.


```r
# get the 1st, 3rd, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector

snp_genes[c(1, 3, 4)]
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"  "AR"    "OPRM1"
```

There are additional (and perhaps less commonly used) ways of subsetting
a vector (see [these
examples](https://thomasleeper.com/Rcourse/Tutorials/vectorindexing.html)).
Also, several of these subsetting expressions can be combined:


```r
# get the 1st through the 3rd value, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector
# yes, this is a little silly in a vector of only 4 values.
snp_genes[c(1:3,4)]
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"  "ACTN3" "AR"    "OPRM1"
```

## Adding to, removing, or replacing values in existing vectors

Once you have an existing vector, you may want to add a new item to it.
To do so, you can use the `c()` function again to add your new value:


```r
# add the gene 'CYP1A1' and 'APOA5' to our list of snp genes
# this overwrites our existing vector
snp_genes <- c(snp_genes, "CYP1A1", "APOA5")
```

We can verify that "snp_genes" contains the new gene entry


```r
snp_genes
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1" "APOA5"
```

Using a negative index will return a version of a vector with that
index's value removed:


```r
snp_genes[-6]
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1"
```

We can remove that value from our vector by overwriting it with this
expression:


```r
snp_genes <- snp_genes[-6]
snp_genes
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1"
```

We can also explicitly rename or add a value to our index using double
bracket notation:


```r
snp_genes[7]<- "APOA5"
snp_genes
```

```
## [1] "OXTR"   "ACTN3"  "AR"     "OPRM1"  "CYP1A1" NA       "APOA5"
```

Notice in the operation above that R inserts an `NA` value to extend our
vector so that the gene "APOA5" is an index 7. This may be a good or
not-so-good thing depending on how you use this.

## Logical Subsetting

There is one last set of cool subsetting capabilities we want to
introduce. It is possible within R to retrieve items in a vector based
on a logical evaluation or numerical comparison. For example, let's say
we wanted get all of the SNPs in our vector of SNP positions that were
greater than 100,000,000. We could index using the '\>' (greater than)
logical operator:


```r
snp_positions[snp_positions > 100000000]
```

```
## [1] 154039662
```

In the square brackets you place the name of the vector followed by the
comparison operator and (in this case) a numeric value. Some of the most
common logical operators you will use in R are:

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| \<       | less than                |
| \<=      | less than or equal to    |
| \>       | greater than             |
| \>=      | greater than or equal to |
| ==       | exactly equal to         |
| !=       | not equal to             |
| !x       | not x                    |
| a \| b   | a or b                   |
| a & b    | a and b                  |

## A few final vector tricks

Finally, there are a few other common retrieve or replace operations you
may want to know about. First, you can check to see if any of the values
of your vector are missing (i.e. are `NA`). Missing data will get a more
detailed treatment later, but the `is.NA()` function will return a
logical vector, with TRUE for any NA value:


```r
# current value of 'snp_genes': 
# chr [1:7] "OXTR" "ACTN3" "AR" "OPRM1" "CYP1A1" NA "APOA5"

is.na(snp_genes)
```

```
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
```

Sometimes, you may wish to find out if a specific value (or several
values) is present a vector. You can do this using the comparison
operator `%in%`, which will return TRUE for any value in your collection
that is in the vector you are searching:


```r
# current value of 'snp_genes':
# chr [1:7] "OXTR" "ACTN3" "AR" "OPRM1" "CYP1A1" NA "APOA5"

# test to see if "ACTN3" or "APO5A" is in the snp_genes vector
# if you are looking for more than one value, you must pass this as a vector

c("ACTN3","APOA5") %in% snp_genes
```

```
## [1] TRUE TRUE
```

## Subsetting Data Frames

The first thing to remember is that a data frame is two-dimensional
(rows and columns). Therefore, to select a specific value we will will
once again use [] (bracket) notation, but we will specify more than one
value (except in some cases where we are taking a range).

**The subsetting notation is very similar to what we learned for
vectors. The key differences include:**

-   Typically provide two values separated by commas: data.frame[row,
    column]
-   In cases where you are taking a continuous range of numbers use a
    colon between the numbers (start:stop, inclusive)
-   For a non continuous set of numbers, pass a vector using `c()`
-   Index using the name of a column(s) by passing them as vectors using
    `c()`

**Finally, in all of the subsetting exercises above, we printed values
to the screen. You can create a new data frame object by assigning them
to a new object name:**

Create a new data frame containing only those genes with an adjusted
P-value less than or equal to 0.05:


```r
# Notice that we need to refer to the correct variable using the `$` operator.
# And also that we use the "," to say that we are selecting ROWS instead of columns. The condition would go AFTER the column for selecting rows. 
pregnant_lactate_sample_filt <- pregnant_lactate_sample[pregnant_lactate_sample$adj.P.Val <= 0.05,]

# check the dimension of the data frame

dim(pregnant_lactate_sample_filt)
```

```
## [1] 353   9
```

```r
# get a summary of the data frame

summary(pregnant_lactate_sample_filt)
```

```

## Comparing data sets in R

**One of the really powerful uses of R is being able to really quickly
compare data frames without much manual work on your end. Try the
following on your own to create a data frame we can compare with the
`pregnant_lactate_sample_filt` data set:**

1.  Import the `virgin_pregnant_sample.csv` into R, creating a
    `data frame` called `virgin_pregnant_sample`.
2.  Filter this data frame so that it includes only genes an adjusted
    P-value less than or equal to 0.05, creating a dataframe called
    `virgin_pregnant_sample_filt`.
3.  Report a summary of this new data frame.

**Now, let's try to answer a question that I am sure you are very
curious about: How many significant genes do these two data sets have in
common?**

Base R has a few very useful set operations built in for answering this
sort of question. We are going to use the `intersect()`function to creat
a vector of the genes that have in common:


```r
overlap <- intersect(pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID,virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID)
```

```
## Error in as.vector(y): object 'virgin_pregnant_sample_filt' not found
```

```r
## Let's see how big the overlap is 
length(overlap) #They share 10 differentially expressed genes
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'overlap' not found
```

We can also perform other set operations, such as `union()`, which
creates a list of all elements in either list, and `setdiff()` which
computes the list of elements in one list but not in the other:


```r
# We can nest the union() function inside the length() function to cut out an intermediate step
length(union(pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID,virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID))
```

```
## Error in as.vector(y): object 'virgin_pregnant_sample_filt' not found
```

```r
# Note that reversing the arguments on setdiff() produces different results: 
length(setdiff(pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID,virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID))
```

```
## Error in as.vector(y): object 'virgin_pregnant_sample_filt' not found
```

```r
length(setdiff(virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID,pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID))
```

```
## Error in as.vector(x): object 'virgin_pregnant_sample_filt' not found
```

Now, let's say that we want to not only get the list of the overlap
between the significant genes, but also extract the rows from each data
frame that correspond to those overlapping genes.

We can do this with the `%in%` operator:


```r
# select the rows in the pregnant_lactate_sample_filt data frame that correspond to those 10 shared genes 
preg_lac_overlap <- pregnant_lactate_sample_filt[pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID %in% overlap,]
```

```
## Error in pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID %in% overlap: object 'overlap' not found
```

```r
summary(preg_lac_overlap)
```

```
## Error in summary(preg_lac_overlap): object 'preg_lac_overlap' not found
```

```r
# select the rows in the virgin_pregnant_sample_filt data frame that correspond to those 10 shared genes
virg_preg_overlap <- virgin_pregnant_sample_filt[virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID %in% overlap,]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'virgin_pregnant_sample_filt' not found
```

```r
summary(virg_preg_overlap)
```

```
## Error in summary(virg_preg_overlap): object 'virg_preg_overlap' not found
```

You can also cut out the step of creating the `overlap` vector by
telling the %in% operator to compare the two columns of data directly,
using a command like the one below:


```r
virg_preg_overlap <- virgin_pregnant_sample_filt[virgin_pregnant_sample_filt$ENTREZID %in% pregnant_lactate_sample_filt$ENTREZID,]
```

## Brief Introduction to the `dplyr` package

When you manipulate more complicated data sets, you may want to make use
of the dplyr() package eventually. It streamlines a lot of the selecting
and filtering steps and lets you chain together lots of commands to
modify and manipulate big data frames. I will just be showing you a few
commands that are equivalent to the ones above.

According to the main tutorial for `dplyr`, it aims to provide a
function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These verbs can be
organised into three categories based on the component of the dataset
that they work with:

**Rows**: filter() chooses rows based on column values. slice() chooses
rows based on location. arrange() changes the order of the rows.

**Columns:** select() changes whether or not a column is included.
rename() changes the name of columns. mutate() changes the values of
columns and creates new columns. relocate() changes the order of the
columns. Groups of rows: summarise() collapses a group into a single
row.

**The Pipe Operator** All of the dplyr functions take a data frame (or
tibble) as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either
save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the `%>%`
operator. `x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)` so the result from one step
is then "piped" into the next step. You can use the pipe to rewrite
multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom
(reading the pipe operator as "then").

### Filtering Data in Dplyr

`filter()` allows you to select a subset of rows in a data frame. Like
all single verbs, the first argument is the tibble (or data frame). The
second and subsequent arguments refer to variables within that data
frame, selecting rows where the expression is TRUE. Let's use `dplyr` to
quickly perform the same filtering operations we did before.


```r
library(dplyr) # Make sure the package is loaded into your environment
```

Creating the filtered data frames again:


```r
pregnant_lactate_sample_filt2 <- pregnant_lactate_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05)
```

```
## Error in pregnant_lactate_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05): could not find function "%>%"
```

```r
virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2 <- virgin_pregnant_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05)
```

```
## Error in virgin_pregnant_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05): could not find function "%>%"
```

Comparing the overlap between the datasets:


```r
preg_lac_overlap2 <- pregnant_lactate_sample_filt2 %>% filter(ENTREZID %in% virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2$ENTREZID)
```

```
## Error in pregnant_lactate_sample_filt2 %>% filter(ENTREZID %in% virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2$ENTREZID): could not find function "%>%"
```

```r
dim(preg_lac_overlap2) 
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'preg_lac_overlap2' not found
```

You could also chain together two of the commands together like below to
get directly to the data frame of `pregnant_lactate_sample` rows where
the adjusted P-value is \< 0.05 **AND** those rows can be found in the
filtered `virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2` data frame:


```r
preg_lac_overlap3 <- pregnant_lactate_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05) %>% filter(ENTREZID %in% virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2$ENTREZID)
```

```
## Error in pregnant_lactate_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05) %>% filter(ENTREZID %in% : could not find function "%>%"
```

```r
dim(preg_lac_overlap3)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'preg_lac_overlap3' not found
```

And finally, you can combine this into an even shorter expression:


```r
preg_lac_overlap4 <- pregnant_lactate_sample %>% filter(adj.P.Val <= 0.05, ENTREZID %in% virgin_pregnant_sample_filt2$ENTREZID)
dim(preg_lac_overlap4)
```
